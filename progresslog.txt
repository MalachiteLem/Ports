23.09.2025 - Start of the work on Port, again
	-Use of Beebo's sprite to make idle, walk and fall sprites
	-Test of allllll of the old code. Everything works, all bugs are the same old
24.09.2025 - The great spriting work
	-Added primary, secondary, utility, special, walk back sprites
	-Added skins: Foe, Friend, Golden, Ocean
	-Re-did code for Shatter and Field, now they should do things properly:
		-Shatter: enemies now walk at 0.05x speed multiplier, and have their attack multiplier is 0.4. Attack multipler doesn't seem to work at all, but not critical.
		-Field: Added visual overlay of magenta/purple color (depending on whether scepter/not, magenta is default and purple is scept); boss enemies don't get their
	attack speed reduced or state set to 50, fixing some of the bugs
	-Adjusted sprites to match
25.09.2025 - The great spriting work 2, electric boogaloo
	-Added placeholders for alt primary, utility and special
	-Added skill icons for alt skills
	-Slightly adjusted older skill icons (also fun fact, I THINK seraph ss1 utility icon is meant to represent the survivor itself and its arms, so the new icon for it
	here represents just that!)
	-Adjusted text files to make the text less clunky to read
26.09.2025 - The great nothing
	-Spent full day working on CSS select sprite, ended up ruining it on accident and have to redo it all
	-Nothing else, felt quite worse than anytime this week, hurt to breathe and headache
27.09.2025 - The great code unshittification and rewrite
	-Started work on rewriting/polishing code, plus making it look prettier and adding comments
	-Added a logbook info that's less of a shitpost, and was written by one of my friends. Basically headcanonning on seraph... what a run huh
	-Refined the shatter and field debuffs code
	-Refined the primary code (less jank, still a lot)
	-Messed around with the sprites
	-Added a hitbox mask
	-Adjusted Primary and Secondary hitbox positions to match new Seraph's hitbox + sprites
	-Started on rewriting Secondary's code
	-Fixed Shatter proccing itself (you hit one shattered enemy in proximity to 4 others, without the shatter debuff - it would summon 5 explosions. Fixed now)
	-RAAAHHHHH fixed that DUMB SHITASS BUG that caused the non-damagers/utility attacks to trigger procs (bleed, atgs, etc with 0 damage) - now orb, utility pull
	and utility bash no longer do that dumb sick shit!!!! (i was blind and didn't see the can_proc property for fire_explosion and fire_direct)
28.09.2025 - The great code unshittification and rewrite 2, and my code was spaghetti
	-Half of the day no progress, temperature + bad headache
	-Started attempts on adjusting the animations to match the skills and vice versa
	-Started attempt at rewriting how the orb works so that utility will be able to push it left/right (pull) and down (bash)
	-Fixed a bug with shatter/field debuffs where if a wandering vagrant/cremator/lem cavalry (any enemy that used projectiles as 'entities', really) would have their
	attacks hanging in the air forever. This is no longer the case.
	-Added much more comments
	-Refined the code to look less clunky
	-Shatter debuff now procs properly with equipment and other items
	-All animations now work properly
	-Seraph now properly slides with their primary, no longer getting their speed reduced when attacking (fixed a bug tldr)
	-Removed the logbook since I didn't like it at alllllll in any way
	-Refined the utility code, making the bash drop enemies more sharply downwards, and pull pull enemies more sharply. Removed redundant arguments like printing and text
	within the alarms used by utility code
	-Added a block of code to prevent fall damage occuring when bashing enemies downwards
	-Adjusted animation span and alarm wait to match each other
	-Changed debuffFielD (no scepter field) to debuffFieldS (scepter field) in the upgraded form of grace field, so that it works properly
	-First multiplayer playtest:
	   Testers: Malachite lem, Fox, Flashi
	Results:
		-Drone sprite didn't work (forgot to define, now fixed)
		-Sounds aren't synced across clients (????)
		-Orbs fired by client don't disappear after hitting the enemy, and stay purely visual (need to network the instance destroy)
		-Alarms used by utility create an error in the console, function nomrally otherwise
		-Prevention of fall damage by utility bash doesn't work at all when in an online co-op run
29.09.2025 - The respriting and reassembly (FORCED_REASSEMBLY REFERENCE IN MY CODE???)
	-Started work on refining walk, idle, walk back cycles to be more pleasant
	-Started work on respriting the entirety of climb, fall and jump cycles
	(All other animations are more than fine, except maybe shoot_2, which has to be a bit more distinct from shoot_1)
	-Started work on making the CSS for Seraph and skins
	-Started on trying to network things
	-Fixed a bug where pull state of utility would pull the enemies with opposite direction (seraph is pulling from left to right, enemy is looking to left due to
	attacking or any other state, and it results in that enemy getting knocked to the left, not right)
	-All for today
30.09.2025 - Buh?
	-Changed the whole concept, now no longer a standalone Seraph port, but rather a fan-port of void content from SS1 into RoRR. Basically, SSR Void Expansion
	(and as such now uses ID ssr_ve)
	-Changed a few things in Seraph
	-Added language tokens for everything I found on void in ss1
	-Added placeholder sprites, sounds and folders for all of void enemies, Edict, plus Nemesis Sniper (Edict's 3rd phase used 3 nemesises,
	and while nemmando and nemmerc are in, there's no third.)
	-Started working on one of strays (Amalgolem)
