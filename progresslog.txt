23.09.2025 - Start of the work on Port, again
	-Use of Beebo's sprite to make idle, walk and fall sprites
	-Test of allllll of the old code. Everything works, all bugs are the same old
24.09.2025 - The great spriting work
	-Added primary, secondary, utility, special, walk back sprites
	-Added skins: Foe, Friend, Golden, Ocean
	-Re-did code for Shatter and Field, now they should do things properly:
		-Shatter: enemies now walk at 0.05x speed multiplier, and have their attack multiplier is 0.4. Attack multipler doesn't seem to work at all, but not critical.
		-Field: Added visual overlay of magenta/purple color (depending on whether scepter/not, magenta is default and purple is scept); boss enemies don't get their
	attack speed reduced or state set to 50, fixing some of the bugs
	-Adjusted sprites to match
25.09.2025 - The great spriting work 2, electric boogaloo
	-Added placeholders for alt primary, utility and special
	-Added skill icons for alt skills
	-Slightly adjusted older skill icons (also fun fact, I THINK seraph ss1 utility icon is meant to represent the survivor itself and its arms, so the new icon for it
	here represents just that!)
	-Adjusted text files to make the text less clunky to read
26.09.2025 - The great nothing
	-Spent full day working on CSS select sprite, ended up ruining it on accident and have to redo it all
	-Nothing else, felt quite worse than anytime this week, hurt to breathe and headache
27.09.2025 - The great code unshittification and rewrite
	-Started work on rewriting/polishing code, plus making it look prettier and adding comments
	-Added a logbook info that's less of a shitpost, and was written by one of my friends. Basically headcanonning on seraph... what a run huh
	-Refined the shatter and field debuffs code
	-Refined the primary code (less jank, still a lot)
	-Messed around with the sprites
	-Added a hitbox mask
	-Adjusted Primary and Secondary hitbox positions to match new Seraph's hitbox + sprites
	-Started on rewriting Secondary's code
	-Fixed Shatter proccing itself (you hit one shattered enemy in proximity to 4 others, without the shatter debuff - it would summon 5 explosions. Fixed now)
	-RAAAHHHHH fixed that DUMB SHITASS BUG that caused the non-damagers/utility attacks to trigger procs (bleed, atgs, etc with 0 damage) - now orb, utility pull
	and utility bash no longer do that dumb sick shit!!!! (i was blind and didn't see the can_proc property for fire_explosion and fire_direct)
